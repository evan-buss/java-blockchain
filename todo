Stage 3:
    Some sort of thread pool to mine the same block as they come in.
    Once a single thread declares victory, the other threads should drop and work on the new one
    The time it takes to mine should be tracked, if it takes less than 10 seconds to mine, the POW number should be increased
        if it takes over a minute to mine a block, the POW number should be reduced by one.

    Not sure if the blockchain should be a singleton?


TODO in the future
Stage 5:
    https://hyperskill.org/projects/50/stages/275/implement

    Need to generate public / private keys for each message.
    Don't feel like doing that right now, as it will require a more robust messaging system.
